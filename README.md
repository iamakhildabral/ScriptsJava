## Introduction

In this repository, I've collected a set of scripts designed to handle and manipulate text files with finesse. From basic data extraction to complex pattern recognition, these scripts aim to make your data-related tasks a breeze.

## Scripts

- **ExtractMFOL.java**: Extracts a substring and put it in a text file for further comparison.


Feel free to explore and adapt these scripts to your specific needs. Each script comes with its own documentation to guide you.

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions, check the documentation provided within each script's file. Generally, you'll need to have Python 3.x and Node.js installed for running the scripts. Clone this repository and navigate to the script's directory to get started.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this repository might have specific dependencies. Make sure to check the documentation for each script to install the necessary libraries or packages.
